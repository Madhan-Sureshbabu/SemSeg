# Semantic Segmentation

This project is a part of Machine Learning Coursework(CS539) at WPI. We have implemented Segnet and 2 other modified architecutures of Segnet for scene understanding.


## Installation

Use the [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) to train and test the model.

System Requirements:

Pytorch 1.3.1
Matplotlib 3.0.3
Torchvision 0.4.2
Python 3.5.2

We trained and tested our code in a system which has 6GB RTX2060 Nividia Graphics card. 


## Usage

1) Download the dataset and change the DATA_PATH in train_test.py
2) Change the architecture you want to train or test in the main fucntion.
3) Run the train_test.py
